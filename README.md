This repository contains javascript(js) and stylesheet(css) files that I use for my websites and single-page-apps(spa).
It contains tagged releases so that the [jsdelivr.com](https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh) CDN can cache and serve them efficiently.
Use [this tool](https://www.jsdelivr.com/github) to transform any GitHub URL to cdn.jsdelivr.net URL.
For example use, see the [index.html](https://github.com/SomajitDey/EasyForm/blob/main/index.html) file used by [EasyForm](https://somajitdey.github.io/EasyForm/).

<strong>One important note</strong>

Use .min.js and .min.css extensions instead of .js and .css when downloading the files from jsdelivr. That will minify the corresponding files for efficiency.
